# ts-app SaaS boilerplate

Interested in something more generic? Check out the [base ts-app branch](https://github.com/lukeautry/ts-app).

The `saas` branch builds on `master` to create a boilerplate suitable for SaaS style apps, i.e. those that have users, authentication, routing, and emails. `saas` also includes some additional tooling for UI development.

All of the documentation in [the base README](./README.BASE.MD) applies to this project.
